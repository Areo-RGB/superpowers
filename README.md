## How it works

It starts from the moment you fire up your coding agent. As soon as it sees that you're building something, it *doesn't* just jump into trying to write code. Instead, it steps back and asks you what you're really trying to do. 

Once it's teased a spec out of the conversation, it shows it to you in chunks short enough to actually read and digest. 

After you've signed off on the design, your agent puts together an implementation plan that's clear enough for an enthusiastic junior engineer with poor taste, no judgement, no project context, and an aversion to testing to follow. It emphasizes true red/green TDD, YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It), and DRY. 

Next up, once you say "go", it launches a *subagent-driven-development* process, having agents work through each engineering task, inspecting and reviewing their work, and continuing forward. It's not uncommon for your agent to work autonomously for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan you put together.

There's a bunch more to it, but that's the core of the system. And because the skills trigger automatically, you don't need to do anything special. Your coding agent just has Superpowers.

## Commercial Services

If you're using Superpowers in enterprise and could benefit from commercial support, additional tooling, or managed spending, please don't hesitate to drop us a line at sales@primeradiant.com.

## Installation

Installation differs by harness. If you use more than one, install Superpowers separately for each one.

**This is the Areo-RGB fork.** Use the repository-based install commands below to get this fork's native-execution workflow and T3 Code approval skills. Built-in/official third-party marketplace listings may still distribute the original upstream plugin; installing those listings does not install this fork.

### Claude Code

The [official Claude plugin marketplace](https://claude.com/plugins/superpowers) lists the upstream package; use the fork marketplace instructions below for this variant.

#### Official Marketplace (upstream package)

- Install the plugin from Anthropic's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official
  ```

#### This fork's Claude marketplace

This repository includes a Claude marketplace manifest named `superpowers-dev`. Register this repository to install this fork.

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin marketplace add Areo-RGB/superpowers
  ```

- Install the plugin from this marketplace:

  ```bash
  /plugin install superpowers@superpowers-dev
  ```

### Antigravity

Install Superpowers as a plugin from this repository:

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/Areo-RGB/superpowers
```

Antigravity lists each installed skill's description, and the description of
the `using-superpowers` skill prompts the model to load that skill at the start
of a conversation. Reinstall with the same command to update.

### Codex App

The [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins) provides the upstream package; it does not automatically provide the Areo-RGB fork.

- In the Codex app, click on Plugins in the sidebar.
- You should see `Superpowers` in the Coding section.
- Click the `+` next to Superpowers and follow the prompts.

### Codex CLI

Superpowers is available via the [official Codex plugin marketplace](https://github.com/openai/plugins).

- Open the plugin search interface:

  ```bash
  /plugins
  ```

- Search for Superpowers:

  ```bash
  superpowers
  ```

- Select `Install Plugin`.

### Cursor

- In Cursor Agent chat, install from marketplace:

  ```text
  /add-plugin superpowers
  ```

- Or search for "superpowers" in the plugin marketplace.

### Devin CLI

- Install the plugin from this repository:

  ```bash
  devin plugins install Areo-RGB/superpowers
  ```

- Update to the latest version with:

  ```bash
  devin plugins update superpowers
  ```

### Factory Droid

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Areo-RGB/superpowers
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  droid plugin install superpowers@superpowers-dev
  ```

### Gemini CLI

- Install the extension:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions install https://github.com/Areo-RGB/superpowers
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  gemini extensions update superpowers
  ```

### GitHub Copilot CLI

- Register the marketplace:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin marketplace add Areo-RGB/superpowers
  ```

- Install the plugin:

  ```bash
  copilot plugin install superpowers@superpowers-dev
  ```

### Grok Build CLI

Superpowers is available via the [official Grok plugin marketplace](https://github.com/xai-org/plugin-marketplace).

- Install the plugin from xAI's official marketplace:

  ```bash
  grok plugin install superpowers@xai-official --trust
  ```

- Or open the marketplace in the TUI, search for Superpowers, and install it:

  ```text
  /marketplace
  ```

### Kimi Code

Kimi Code's built-in marketplace may provide the upstream package; use the direct repository URL below for this fork.

- Open Kimi Code's plugin manager:

  ```text
  /plugins
  ```

- Go to `Marketplace` > `Superpowers` and install it.

- Or install directly from this repository:

  ```text
  /plugins install https://github.com/Areo-RGB/superpowers
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.kimi.md](docs/README.kimi.md)

### OpenCode

OpenCode uses its own plugin install; install Superpowers separately even if you
already use it in another harness.

- Tell OpenCode:

  ```
  Fetch and follow instructions from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Areo-RGB/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.opencode/INSTALL.md
  ```

- Detailed docs: [docs/README.opencode.md](docs/README.opencode.md)

### Pi

Install Superpowers as a Pi package from this repository:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/Areo-RGB/superpowers
```

For local development, run Pi with this checkout loaded as a temporary package:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/superpowers
```

The Pi package loads the Superpowers skills and a small extension that injects the `using-superpowers` bootstrap at session startup and again after compaction. Pi has native skills, so no compatibility `Skill` tool is required. The independent T3 Code review process uses its MCP connection, not an alternate implementation workflow.

### Qwen Code

Qwen Code installs plugins from Claude Code marketplaces directly.

- Install the plugin from this repository, and pick `superpowers` when prompted:

  ```bash
  qwen extensions install Areo-RGB/superpowers
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  qwen extensions update superpowers
  ```

### Hermes Agent

Install Superpowers as a Hermes plugin from this repository:

```bash
hermes plugins install Areo-RGB/superpowers --enable
```

Restart any active Hermes sessions after installing. Note: Hermes has no
post-compaction hook, so a very long session that compacts over its first
turn loses the bootstrap — start a fresh session if skills stop triggering.

### Muse

Superpowers is available as a native Muse plugin — same repo, same skills, all harnesses. The `using-superpowers` bootstrap is injected via the native `SessionStart` hook alongside Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Pi, and the rest — no per-session opt-in.

- Install from a local checkout:

  ```bash
  muse plugins install ./
  muse plugins approve superpowers
  ```

  Or clone and install:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Areo-RGB/superpowers.git
  muse plugins install ./superpowers
  muse plugins approve superpowers
  ```

- Update later:

  ```bash
  muse plugins update superpowers
  ```

Restart any active Muse sessions after installing so the `SessionStart` hook takes effect — skills are active immediately, hooks require approval on first install. To verify, start a fresh session and send `Let's make a react todo list` — a working install auto-triggers `brainstorming` before any code is written. Version is tracked in `.version-bump.json` so `scripts/bump-version.sh` keeps it in sync.

## The Basic Workflow

1. **brainstorming** — Defines the goal and design, then uses an independent GPT-6.1 Sol / High reviewer in T3 Code for the design gate.
2. **writing-plans** — Produces a testable implementation plan and routes the plan gate to that independent reviewer.
3. **executing-plans** — The current agent implements all tasks natively in the existing checkout, using test-driven development.
4. **requesting-code-review** — A separate read-only T3 Code reviewer checks the actual diff and test evidence. Each approval request carries the complete `t3-approver/SKILL.md` instructions.
5. **finishing-a-development-branch** — Verifies completion and preserves the existing branch unless a separate, authorized integration action was requested.

**Routine engineering approvals are model-driven, not user sign-off steps.** Actual platform permission and user authorization requirements remain in effect. The agent checks for relevant skills before any task.

## When Something Goes Wrong

Sometimes a session misbehaves: a skill fires when it shouldn't, stays silent when it should, or the agent ignores its plan, repeats work, or burns more tokens than you'd expect. Ask your coding agent to "figure out what went wrong with superpowers in this session" and it will invoke the **diagnosing-superpowers** skill. To examine an earlier session, name it: "figure out what went wrong with superpowers in session `<id>`".

The skill reads the session transcript, reports what happened with line-level evidence, and, if you want, packages a scrubbed bundle for a bug report.

## Contributing

The general contribution process for Superpowers is below. Keep in mind that we don't generally accept contributions of new skills and that any updates to skills must work across all of the coding agents we support. We also don't accept agent-written PRs that fix issues filed by someone else unless a maintainer asked for one, even when you hit the same problem; add your report to the existing issue instead.

1. Fork the repository
2. Start from the current `main` branch
3. Create a feature branch for your changes
4. Follow the `writing-skills` skill for creating and testing new and modified skills
5. Submit a PR, filling in every section of the pull request template, including the summary a human writes in their own words.

Skill-behavior tests use the drill eval harness from [superpowers-evals](https://github.com/prime-radiant-inc/superpowers-evals/), cloned into `evals/` — see `evals/README.md` for setup. Plugin-infrastructure tests live at `tests/` and run via the relevant `run-*.sh` or `npm test`.

See `skills/writing-skills/SKILL.md` for the complete guide.

## Updating

Superpowers updates are somewhat coding-agent dependent, but are often automatic.

## Visual companion telemetry

Because skills and plugins don't provide any feedback to creators, we have no idea how many of you are using Superpowers. By default, the Prime Radiant logo on brainstorming's optional visual companion feature is loaded from our website. It includes the version of Superpowers in use. It does not include any details about your project, prompt, or coding agent. We don't see your clicks or anything about what you're building. This helps us have a rough idea of how many folks are using Superpowers and which version of Superpowers they're using. It's 100% optional. To disable this, set the environment variable `SUPERPOWERS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` to any true value. Superpowers also honors Claude Code's `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` and `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC` opt-outs.
